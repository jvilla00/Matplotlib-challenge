# Matplotlib-challenge
------------------------------------------
This repository demonstrates how the use of matplotlib could help when analyzing a data set and creating visuals.
 
Analysis:

* The effectiveness of the drug Capomulin. When studying the charts provided, specifically the box plot, it was clear that Capomulin was effective in reducing tumor growth. This is shown in the line plot graph. When comparing different mice that took Capomulin you can see that as the timepoints progress the tumor sizes decrease.
* I noted that mice gender did not play a part in determining the effectiveness of the drug regimen. When evaluating whether there was an increase/decrease in tumor volume, the gender was equally represented. 
* There is a relationship between the weight of the rat vs how big the tumor is, when looking at the drug Capomulin. The trend was that the more the rat weighed, the bigger the tumor. Now, comparing this to a less effective drug like Infubinol. This drug had no correlation between weight and tumor size. The scatter plot had no consistent trends. When looking at a weight vs tumor plot, having a positive linear relationship tends to be a more effective drug.
